# Log-likelihood approximation for LC models when using stochastic EM algorithm

This is the code we used for the simulations in the paper "Log-likelihood approximation when using
stochastic EM in latent class models". 
The code in this version is available for simulation reproducibility purposes only.

## Usage
To run the simulations launch the .R files, which recalls a C++ program. Be sure to have installed .R, and the R packages Rcpp, RcppEigen and
RcppArmadillo.
